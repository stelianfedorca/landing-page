# What I've learned doing this project

## 1. Box-sizing

- the `border-box` value basically tells the browser to account for any padding and margin that you give to an element when you specify width and height<br>
  Example: set element's width to be 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content will shrink to absorb that extra width

## 2. `a` html tag

- defines a hyperlink, which is used to to link one page to another
- the `href` attribute is used to specify the link's destination
